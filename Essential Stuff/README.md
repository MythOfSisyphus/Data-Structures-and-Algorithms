This folder is for literally *Essential Stuff*.

We won't be solving or writing code of important/challanging problems, for that we already have a dedicated folder.

This folder exists to fill gaps in my learning. 


For example when I was learning backtracking which higly relies on recursion and I was not getting anything how that function is working just by calling itself again and again. So I thought why not learn recusion and solve some basic/intermediate problems on that then go back to backtracking. Same follows for Dynamic Programming, Trees, Graphs etc.

For some awesome problems on *Recursion* see [*Recursion_Basics*](https://github.com/MythOfSisyphus/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/master/Essential%20Stuff/Recursion_Basics) and [*Challanging Problems*](https://github.com/MythOfSisyphus/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/master/Challaging%20Problems).

*Keep learning, keep growing!*
