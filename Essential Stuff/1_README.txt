This folder is for literally "Essential Stuff".
We won't be solving or writing code of important/challanging problems, for that we already have a dedicated folder.

This folder exists to fill gaps in my learning. 
For example when I was learning backtracking which higly relies on recursion and I was not getting anything how that function is working just by calling itself again and again. So I thought why not learn recusion and solve some basic/intermediate problems on that then go back to backtracking. Same follows for Dynamic Programming, Trees, Graphs etc.
