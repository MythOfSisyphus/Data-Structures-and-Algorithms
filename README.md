# Dear strangers,
As *Seneca* says:

>*There is no enjoying the possession of anything valuable unless one has someone to share it with. I shall send you, accordingly, the actual books themselves, and to save you a lot of trouble hunting all over the place for passages likely to be of use to you, I shall mark the passages so that you can turn straight away to the words I approve and admire.*

So you want to learn *Algorithms* or improve your *problem solving skill*, right?

It is really a nice initiative to learn it, as it makes us better at approaching various problems.
I have shared many problems in specific folders so that you can just learn what you want to learn. 
I just want to say there will be times when you'll see no progress even after spending whole day thinking about let's say a *recusion* or *dynamic programming* problem.
But don't let this affect you, come back to that problem after some time or day then you'll apparently see your mistakes in your previous attempts.

Remember *Time spent thinking about a problem is always time worth spent. Even 
if you seem to make no progress at all.*

# Why this repository?
I always wanted to learn *Data Structures and Algorithms* but I was procrastinating since 2022.

After feeling too guilty on my mistaked, I told myself "Now no more procrastination. This time I'm going to learn all those algorithms that I always wanted to learn and solve problems that I always wanted to solve."

That's why I created this repo to track record of my process.

# What makes it different from many existing repositories?
Well, so all files are well arranged and contain lots of comments.

Yeah, I admit there are still some files that contain *no comments* at all because I thought *there is no need to do any comment as everything is clear from the code.* I have given links of some articles/blogs which I found interesting. For example there is an awesome article for [*Merge Sort*](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/merge-sort) on *Programiz* so I thought "why I should explain, when there is already an excellant explanation available?"

So you won't be panicked after seeing lots of file and code in that because I have tried and still trying to make this repo fully 
understandable by anyone.

And I have tried my best not to add those boring and easy problems. You can see [*Few Challanging Problems.md*](https://github.com/MythOfSisyphus/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/master/Challaging%20Problems/Miscellaneous/Few%20Challenging%20Problems.md) to get an idea about 
level of problems in this repository.

# Now how to start & where to go?
If you're a begineer with no knoweledge of *Data Structure and Algorithms* then I would suggest you to read a book that I mentioned below, learn at least one programming language and try to solve some interesting problems. 

Browse [*Essential Stuff*](https://github.com/MythOfSisyphus/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/master/Essential%20Stuff) to be familiar with some *DSA* and just ask yourself daily *how can I do little more better than I did today? what are things I need to learn in order to understand this or that algorithm?*
I would like to give you an example from my own journey of making and learning all stuff of this repo. When I was having difficulty in understanding code of many [*Backtracking Problems*](https://github.com/MythOfSisyphus/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/master/Challaging%20Problems/Backtracking_Problems) I was trying very hard but I was not getting "how recursion working in this?" Then I read more about recursion and solve many problems by myself one on which I feel happy that I solved was [*Pascal Triangle*](https://github.com/MythOfSisyphus/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/master/Essential%20Stuff/Recursion_Basics/Pascal_Triangle.cpp). Free feel if you want to improve this and other files.

I'm grateful to an amazing book [**Algorithm by Jeff Erickson**](https://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/book) and [**CP-Algorithm**](cp-algorithms.com/index.html) no doubt both are excellent resources and there are lots of things to learn from these resources.
I have also included solutions of some problems mentioned there.

Take care, and free feel to make some changes where you think *is necessary*.
