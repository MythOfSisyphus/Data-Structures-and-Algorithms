# Why this repository?
I always wanted to learn *Data Structures and Algorithms* but I was procrastinating since 2022.

Then I told myself "Now no more procrastination. This time I'm going to learn all those algorithms that I want to learn and solve 
problems that I always wanted to solve."

That's why I created this repo to track record of my process.

# What makes it different from many existing repositories?
Well, so all files are well arranged and contain lots of comments.
So you won't be panicked after seeing lots of file and code in that because I have tried and still trying to make this repo fully 
understandable by anyone.

And I have tried my best not to add those boring and easy problems. You can see *Few Challanging Problems.md* to get an idea about 
level of problems in this repository.

I'm grateful to an amazing book [**Algorithm by Jeff Erickson**](https://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/book) and [**CP-Algorithm**](cp-algorithms.com/index.html) no doubt both are excellent resources and there are lots of things to learn from it.
I have also included solutions of some problems mentioned there.

Take care, and free feel to make some changes where you think *is necessary*.
